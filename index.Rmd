# Introduction

- This project argues for a choice functional analysis of the indefinite article in White Hmong.

- Our discussion includes the indefinite article *ib* and two common classifiers (*tus* and *cov*).

--

## Research questions

1. What are the individual meanings of *ib*, *tus*, and *cov*?

2. How does the indefinite article *ib* combine with with *tus* and *cov* classifier phrases?

# Hmong Data

# Data

## Demographics

- All of my data and discussion are based on elicitation on Zoom with Mai-Ying Xiong and in person with Keng
Xiong, two White Hmong speakers who were raised in Wisconsin (WI). 

- Keng was born in WI and Ying immigrated to the US at age 4.

knitr::include_graphics("./images/clf_denotations.png")
```

--

**Classifiers:**

- both take a bare noun as their argument

--

- *tus* requires that the NP's referent be "atomic" ("AT(x)") but *cov* has no atomicity requirement

--

- when they combine with an NP (bare noun, type *e*), they output a predicate type (⟨*e,t*⟩)

**what's it do???**

# Proposal

```{r, out.width="50%", out.height="auto", dpi=900, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("./images/ib.png")
```

--

**What does this mean?**

- *ib* takes a predicate of type ⟨*e,t*⟩ as an argument 

- outputs another predicate of type ⟨*e,t*⟩

--

- then the choice function ***???***

# Proposal

## Contexts 

```{r, out.width="50%", out.height="auto", dpi=900, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("./images/sg_contexts.png")
```

--

**How are the referents for each phrase determined in this context?**

--

- (14a) is a definite phrase, so its reference is typically determined by 1) discourse relevance of a certain dog in the context, 2) pointing at a specific dog

--

- (14b) is truly so non-specific that each dog in the context is an equally likely referent. if a speaker meant to refer to one of the three dogs specifically, they would say *tus aub* instead of *ib tus aub*

--

- the choice function analysis correctly captures the random referent in the context

---

## Contexts

knitr::include_graphics("./images/pl_contexts.png")
```
--
```{r, out.width="90%", out.height="auto", dpi=900, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("./images/antipresupposition.png")
```

--

**How are the referents for each phrase determined in this context?**

--

- (15a) is a definite phrase, so the iota operator requires it to refer to the full group in the context

--

- (15b) shows that *ib cov aub* can semantically refer to any atomic or nonatomic entity in the context. **BUT**, because of _antipresupposition_, the options in (15c) are the only pragmatically sound referents in the context for *ib cov aub*

### Antipresupposition

---

# Conclusion 

- analyzing *ib* as a choice function correctly captures how different referents are determined in singular and plural classifiers

--

- singular indefinite phrases (*ib tus NP*) are highly non-specific and thus can refer to any atomic entity in the context 

--

- plural indefinite phrases (*ib cov NP*) are also non-specific, but semantically can refer to any atomic or non-atomic entity in the context

--

- along with the concept of antipresupposition, a choice functional analysis correctly predicts that *ib cov NP* can only refer to non-maximal and non-atomic entities in the context
