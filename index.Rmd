# Introduction

- This project argues for a choice functional analysis of the indefinite article in White Hmong.

- Our discussion includes the indefinite article *ib* and two common classifiers (*tus* and *cov*).

--

## Research questions

1. What are the individual meanings of *ib*, *tus*, and *cov*?

2. How does the indefinite article *ib* combine with with *tus* and *cov* classifier phrases?

# Hmong Data

# Data

## Speaker information

- All of my data and discussion are based on elicitation on Zoom with **Ying** and in person with **Keng**, two White Hmong speakers who were raised in Wisconsin (WI). 

--

- Keng was born in WI and Ying immigrated to the US at age 4.

- Also they're siblings

## Definites (Bare classifier phrases)

```{r, fig.retina=2, out.width="60%", out.height="auto", dpi=900, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("./images/data_bare_clfp.png")
```

--

(1) ***tus aub*** can only refer to 1 unique, specific dog in the relevant context

(2) ***cov aub*** can only refer to the full group of dogs in the context


---

# Data

## Indefinites 

```{r, fig.retina=1, out.width="55%", out.height="55%", dpi=900, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("./images/data_indefinites.png")
```

--

(3) ***ib tus aub*** can refer to any one of the dogs in the context

(4) ***ib cov aub*** can refer to any subgroup of the dogs in the context

## Definites

```{r, fig.retina=2, out.width="55%", out.height="auto", dpi=900, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("./images/clf_denotations.png")
```

--

**Classifiers:**

- both take a bare noun as their argument

--

- *tus* requires that the NP's referent be "atomic" ("AT(x)") but *cov* has no atomicity requirement

--

- when they combine with an NP (bare noun, type *e*), they output a predicate type (⟨*e,t*⟩)


---

# Proposal

## Definites 

```{r, fig.retina=2, out.width="95%", out.height="auto", dpi=900, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("./images/iota.png")
```

**What do I need to know about this operator?**

--

- ι is roughly equivalent to a definite article like *the* 

- as a null equivalent to *the*, *the dogs* would pick out the largest plurality of dogs (Chierchia 1997)

--

**For Hmong,**

- this ι operator gives us the unique definite reading for bare classifier phrases with *tus*

- and it gives us a maximal reading in bare classifier phrases with *cov*

## Indefinites

```{r, fig.retina=2, out.width="50%", out.height="auto", dpi=900, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("./images/ib.png")
```

--

**What does this mean?**

- *ib* takes a predicate of type ⟨*e,t*⟩ as an argument 

- it outputs another predicate of type ⟨*e,t*⟩

--

- the choice function applies to a grouping of entities and arbitrarily selects one of the entities as its referent (Winter 1997)

# Proposal

## Contexts 

```{r, fig.retina=2, out.width="50%", out.height="auto", dpi=900, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("./images/sg_contexts.png")
```

--

**How are the referents for each phrase determined in this context?**

--

- (14a) is a definite phrase, so its reference is typically determined by 1) discourse relevance of a certain dog in the context, 2) pointing at a specific dog

--

- (14b) is truly so non-specific that each dog in the context is an equally likely referent. if a speaker meant to refer to one of the three dogs specifically, they would say *tus aub* instead of *ib tus aub*

--

- the choice function analysis correctly captures the random referent in the context

---

## Contexts

knitr::include_graphics("./images/pl_contexts.png")
```
--
```{r, fig.retina=2, out.width="90%", out.height="auto", dpi=900, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("./images/antipresupposition.png")
```

--

**How are the referents for each phrase determined in this context?**

--

- (15a) is a definite phrase, so the ι operator requires it to refer to the full group in the context

--

- (15b) shows that *ib cov aub* can semantically refer to any atomic or non-atomic entity in the context. **BUT**, because of _antipresupposition_, the options in (15c) are the only pragmatically sound referents in the context for *ib cov aub*  



---

# Proposal

### Antipresupposition

**What is it?**

--

Antipresupposition ***"imposes the condition that the interlocutors not take the truth of a certain proposition for granted"*** (Percus 2006)

--

- for plural indefinites, the choice function does not select the largest entity, otherwise, ι would be the determiner chosen for the utterance instead of *ib* 

--

- the choice function also does not select an atomic entity, otherwise, the classifier *tus* would have been chosen instead of *cov*

--

- **thus,** antipresupposition yields the non-singular and non-maximal entities as the only pragmatically sound options when *ib cov aub* is uttered

---

# Conclusion 

- analyzing *ib* as a choice function correctly captures how different referents are determined with singular and plural classifiers

--

- singular indefinite phrases (***ib tus NP***) are highly non-specific and thus can refer to any atomic entity in the context 

--

- plural indefinite phrases (***ib cov NP***) are also non-specific, but semantically can refer to any atomic or non-atomic entity in the context

--

- along with the concept of antipresupposition, a choice functional analysis correctly predicts that *ib cov NP* can only refer to non-maximal and non-atomic entities in the context
